# PITCH: Movie & Show Picker

_A multi-agent AI system that recommends movies & shows based on natural language requests._

## The Problem

Choosing _what to watch_ has become harder than watching itself.

People don’t struggle because there aren’t enough movies or shows — they struggle because:

- everyone has different tastes
- time is limited (flights, breaks, evenings)
- moods matter (light, intense, comforting, smart)
- group decisions introduce friction

Scrolling endlessly through Netflix or asking friends usually ends in compromise, frustration, or giving up.

## The Idea

**Movie & Show Picker** is a natural-language powered movie & TV recommendation engine.

Instead of clicking filters, users simply _talk_:

> “I have a 1 hour flight, want something light and funny.”
>
> “Movie night for 5 people, no horror, not too heavy.”

Behind the scenes, a multi-agent AI system understands the request, extracts constraints, searches a catalog, and explains _why_ a recommendation fits.

It feels like talking to Netflix — but smarter, faster, and more human.

## What Makes It Different

This isn’t a single AI prompt guessing an answer.

It’s a **multi-agent system**, where:

- one agent understands _intent_
- another extracts _preferences & constraints_
- a deterministic search tool filters candidates
- a final agent ranks results and explains the choice

Each agent has a clear responsibility — just like a real software system.

## Why It Matters

- Users save time and decision fatigue
- Groups reach consensus faster
- Recommendations respect real-world constraints (time, mood, group dynamics)

More importantly, this project demonstrates how **AI can be designed as a system**, not a black box.

## The Vision

Today, Movie & Show Picker runs on a static catalog.

Tomorrow, the same architecture can power:

- streaming platforms
- travel entertainment
- personalized content discovery

The core idea scales — the dataset is just a detail.

**Movie & Show Picker isn’t about movies.**

It’s about building AI systems that reason, collaborate, and explain — the way good software should.
